## Creation Process
I started with creating the user story and drawing a wireframe to map out my game layout. From there, I wrote HTML and CSS for page layout.  Afterward, I moved on to writing the game logic in javascript and jQuery. Upon completion, I used AJAX to create authentication when signing up, signing in and changing password, as well as saving, updating and getting the games.

## Unsolved Problems
I would like to have been able to do an automatic sign in after a successful sign up.
