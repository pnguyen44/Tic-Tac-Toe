# The Game
This tic-tac-toe browser game was my first foray into web development. It allows users to play the game, save it, get scores, and retrieve the previous unfinished game. It was created using Javascript, AJAX, jQuery, Bootstrap, HTML, and CSS/SASS.  I ensured that my app was mobile-friendly to serve users on a variety of devices.


## User Stories
- When user clicks on "Account" button, user can sign up and sign in or change password and sign out.

- When user signs in, user can play the tic tac toe game.

- When user clicks on a box in the tic tac toe board, “X” or “O” will appear depending on which player's turn it is.

- If a user selects a box that has already has an “X” or ‘O”, nothing will happen, and will continue to be the current player’s turn, until user selects an empty box.

- If all the box has been selected and there is no winner, a message will display that there is a tie

- When a player wins, a message will display who the winner is.

- User will also be able to click "Clear Game" to play another game.

- User can see their scores in the score board and the history of games played and games won in the Player X's History section.

## Creation Process
I started with creating the user story and drawing a wireframe to map out my game layout. From there, I wrote HTML and CSS for page layout.  Afterward, I moved on to writing the game logic in javascript and jQuery. Upon completion, I used AJAX to create authentication when signing up, signing in and changing password, as well as saving, updating and getting the games.

## Unsolved Problems
I would like to have been able to do an automatic sign in after a successful sign up.
